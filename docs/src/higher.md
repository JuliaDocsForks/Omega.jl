# Higher Order Inference

Another unique property of Omega is our approach to higher-order inference with `rcd` and `rid`.
Many probabilistic programming languages are built on languages which support higher-order functions and hence are themselves called higher-order probabilistic programming languages.
Omega has a different

In Omega, rcd is implemented with a function
